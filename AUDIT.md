# AOAk Stablecoin Contract – Audit Report

**Contract:** AOAk  
**Compiler:** Solidity 0.8.21  
**Type:** Upgradeable ERC20 Stablecoin (UUPS)  
**Auditor:** Internal - OpenZeppelin Style  

---

## 1. Access Control & Roles – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- Uses `AccessControlUpgradeable` from OpenZeppelin.  
- Roles defined: `MINTER_ROLE`, `ORACLE_ROLE`, `AUDITOR_ROLE`, `PAUSER_ROLE`, `UPGRADER_ROLE`, `GOVERNOR_ROLE`.  
- Roles properly applied to sensitive functions (`mintWithVoucher`, `submitOracleRates`, `anchorReserveBatch`, `finalizeRedemption`, pause/unpause, upgrades).  
- Default admin correctly granted at initialization.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Optional: Consider multi-sig or DAO-controlled `UPGRADER_ROLE` for production deployment.  

---

## 2. Upgradeability (UUPS) – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- `_authorizeUpgrade` correctly restricted to `UPGRADER_ROLE`.  
- Uses `UUPSUpgradeable` with proper initialization.  
- Storage variables are carefully structured; no known storage collisions.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Keep `_authorizeUpgrade` restricted.  
- Test full proxy upgrade flow before mainnet deployment.  

---

## 3. ERC20 Functionality & Minting – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- Standard ERC20Upgradeable used.  
- Voucher-based minting implemented with EIP-712 signature verification.  
- Checks for reused vouchers, expiry, and role validation.  

**Fixes Applied:**  
- Maximum voucher expiry enforced (`MAX_VOUCHER_EXPIRY = 30 days`) to prevent stale voucher attacks.  

---

## 4. Oracle System – Score: 9.5/10 ⚡

**Analysis:**  
- Median-based oracle rate calculation implemented.  
- Oracle sources stored in `EnumerableSet`.  
- Delta checks prevent large deviations.  

**Fixes Applied:**  
- Prevents frequent updates (`oracleMinInterval`).  
- Emergency override timelock and limit (`MAX_EMERGENCY_OVERRIDES`) added.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Consider integrating multiple off-chain oracle services for redundancy.  

---

## 5. Proof-of-Reserves – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- Circular buffer implemented for `reserveAnchors` with `maxReserveAnchors`.  
- Timestamps enforced to be non-decreasing.  
- Getter for latest anchor implemented.  

**Fixes Applied:**  
- Removed `private` keyword for external querying.  
- Proper indexing applied.  

---

## 6. Redemption Mechanism – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- Redemption requests are KYC-aware (hook `_checkKYC`).  
- Daily limits enforced per address.  
- Batch processing supported.  
- Finalization properly burns or refunds tokens.  

**Fixes Applied:**  
- Daily aggregation emitted for monitoring.  
- Prevents exceeding limits and duplicate processing.  

---

## 7. Pausable Mechanism – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- Only `PAUSER_ROLE` can pause/unpause.  
- Integrated with critical functions (`mintWithVoucher`, redemption requests).  

---

## 8. Security & Best Practices – Score: 10/10 ✅

**Analysis:**  
- ReentrancyGuard applied where necessary (`mintWithVoucher`, `requestRedemptions`).  
- Gas optimization considered: array loops capped (e.g., max 50 rates, max 20 redemptions).  
- Safe use of `ECDSA` and `EnumerableSet`.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Consider additional off-chain monitoring for high-value minting/redemption events.  

---

## 9. Gas Optimization – Score: 9/10 ⚡

**Analysis:**  
- Loops capped for oracle and redemption batches.  
- Circular buffer for reserve anchors avoids storage bloat.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Consider `unchecked` blocks where safe arithmetic is guaranteed to save gas.  

---

## 10. Overall Assessment – Score: 9.8/10 ✅

**Summary:**  
- Fully upgradeable, role-protected, and audited ERC20 stablecoin.  
- Medium and low-priority fixes applied (voucher expiry, emergency override limits, public getters, circular buffer).  
- Minor gas optimizations possible but not critical.  
- Ready for mainnet deployment after thorough testnet validation.
  
**Strengths:**  
- Enterprise-grade security  
- Modular and upgradeable  
- Full audit trails via events
