![Angola Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Flag_of_Angola.svg)

## Overview
The Angolan Kwanza (AOA) has faced significant challenges due to high inflation, currency volatility, and dependence on oil revenues. Angola Digital Kwanza (AOAk) offers a complementary digital stablecoin infrastructure that is fully collateralized with USD reserves, giving both local and international users a safe, transparent, and efficient means of transacting in a Kwanza-backed digital form.

AOAk, a blockchain-based stablecoin, is pegged **1:1 to the Angolan Kwanza (AOA)** and backed **100% by United States Dollar (USD)** reserves held in a secure offshore custodian bank.

It provides a transparent, secure, and programmable digital currency that addresses Angola’s need for a modern financial instrument, bridging local users with the global financial system.
