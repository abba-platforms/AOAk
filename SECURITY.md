- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigations (optional)

We take security seriously and will respond promptly to all reports.

## Supported Versions

- **Whitepaper & Documentation:** Refer to `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` and `docs/ANGOLA_ANALYSIS.md`

## Responsible Disclosure

By reporting a vulnerability:
- You agree not to publicly disclose it before a fix is released.
- You grant the AOAk team reasonable time to resolve the issue.
- AOAk follows responsible disclosure practices and may publicly acknowledge contributions after resolution.

## Security Best Practices

- Only interact with the official AOAk smart contract (`contracts/AOAk.sol`).  
- Verify contract addresses from official AOAk channels.  
- Store private keys securely; AOAk team never requests private keys.  
- Regularly update wallets and dApp interfaces to prevent exposure to phishing attacks.
