## Executive Summary

The Angola Digital Kwanza (AOAk) is a Blockchain-based next-generation stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the Angola Kwanza (AOA). AOAk is 100% backed by United States Dollar (USD) held in a secure offshore custodian bank, ensuring full transparency and stability for all holders. It is designed to provide Angolans and international users with a reliable digital asset that mirrors the value of the AOA while being fully compliant with international standards.

AOAk leverages the Ethereum-compatible BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and is implemented as an upgradeable, enterprise-grade ERC20 smart contract. The contract is designed with the flexibility to migrate to ERC-3643 should regulatory requirements necessitate advanced compliance features.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of AOAk is to provide a stable digital currency alternative in Angola that is pegged to the national currency while offering the benefits of blockchain technology including instant transfers, security, transparency, and programmability.

### 1.2 Background
Traditional banking and currency systems in Angola face challenges such as liquidity issues and slow cross-border transactions. AOAk seeks to bridge these gaps by offering a blockchain-native stablecoin fully backed by USD in offshore custodianship, mitigating local banking constraints while maintaining full parity with the Kwanza.

## 2. Market Overview

Angola has a rapidly growing digital economy and a population increasingly adopting mobile money and cryptocurrency solutions. AOAk addresses key market pain points:
- Lack of stable digital representation of Kwanza
- Slow and expensive international transfers
- Limited access to secure digital banking

By offering a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to AOA, AOAk allows local users to transact instantly and securely, while giving international users a reliable entry point into the Angolan market.

## 3. Token Design

### 3.1 Technical Overview
- **Standard:** ERC20 (Upgradeable, migration-ready to ERC-3643)
- **Chain:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Name:** Angola Digital Kwanza (AOAk)
- **Ticker:** AOAK
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Total Supply:** Dynamic, fully collateralized by USD

### 3.2 Backing
AOAk is **100% backed by USD** in a secure offshore custodian bank. Each AOAk issued corresponds to an equal USD amount held in reserve. This ensures:
- Full redemption capability for AOAk holders
- Stability of peg to AOA
- Transparent reserves anchored periodically on-chain via Merkle proofs

---

## 4. Reserve Mechanism

### 4.1 Proof-of-Reserves
AOAk implements a proof-of-reserves mechanism where auditors can anchor Merkle roots and metadata on-chain. This provides cryptographic verification of full USD backing for circulating AOAk tokens.

### 4.2 Reserve Anchors
- Circular buffer to store reserve snapshots
- Configurable buffer size (default 100)
- Anchored via IPFS CIDs and timestamps

---

## 5. Oracle Integration

AOAk maintains accurate exchange rates via a decentralized oracle system:
- Approved oracle sources submit AOAk/USD rates
- Median rate calculation ensures stability
- Delta limits (default 5%) prevent manipulation
- Emergency overrides with timelocks for rapid corrective action

---
