# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡´ ANGOLA ANALYSIS

## Angola: Country Overview

Angola, located in Southern Africa, is a resource-rich nation with a population of approximately 39 million people as of 2025. The country has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, driven primarily by the oil and natural resource sectors. Angola is making strides in modernizing its infrastructure, banking systems, and digital economy, positioning itself for broader economic diversification.

## Economic Landscape

The Angolan economy is characterized by its reliance on oil exports, which form a significant portion of government revenue and foreign exchange reserves. While oil revenue has supported national development, fluctuations in global oil prices and other macroeconomic factors have highlighted the need for a more resilient financial ecosystem.

## Currency Overview: Angola Kwanza (AOA)

The Angolan Kwanza (AOA) serves as the national currency. Over recent years, the AOA has experienced gradual depreciation against major international currencies, reflecting broader macroeconomic trends. Inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while moderate, have had an impact on everyday financial transactions and international trade.
